                <h1>This isn't your typical family-owned restaurant.</h1>
                <p>The Depot Diner is a family-owned restaurant that offers a 1960s dining experience in one of the most unique spots on Table Rock Lake. Located next to Table Rock Airport, the diner sits just 200 feet from an airstrip that was originally built in 1962.</p>
                <p>When Carol and Chuck Leininger, owners of the Depot Diner, bought a home near Lake Point Landing, they were inspired to not only bring the runway back to life but also open a quality restaurant and event center. Originally from Lincoln, Nebraska, the Leiningers love local places where friends meet and neighbors gather for a great meal and conversation. That's exactly what the Depot Diner brings to Golden, Missouri.</p>

                <h3>The Design Inspiration</h3>
                <p>A neighbor at Lake Point Landing is credited for sketching the concept of this nostalgic diner. And when a friend of the Leiningers had access to an East Coast vintage dining car, the full design inspiration for the Depot Diner was born. The diner is an open concept restaurant, where customers can sit at the counter or in a booth and watch the cooks grill up a great meal while catching up with friends.</p>

                <h3>Hangar at Point 25</h3>
                <p>Since the diner is located right next to the airport, it came with a hangar that's perfect for private events and meetings. Hangar at Point 25 has become the home to beloved local events such as Chiggerfest, and hosting 4th of July concerts has become a new tradition. It will be available to rent soon. <strong>Stay posted for details!</strong></p>
